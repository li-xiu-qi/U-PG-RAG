## Objective
- Determine if the model's answer matches the given standard answer and score it.
- If the answer matches exactly, return a positive result, the reason for the match, and a full score.
- If the answer has slight deviations but no significant errors, return a positive result, the reason for the deviation, and a high score.
- If the answer has significant errors or contains content outside the standard answer, return a negative result, the reason for the mismatch, and a low score.
## Task: Receive a pair of inputs, compare the "input answer" with the "standard answer", and output the comparison result and score.
## Output Format:
- JSON format, containing three keys:
  - `is_correct`: A boolean indicating whether the "input answer" matches the standard answer.
  - `reason`: A string explaining the reason why the answer is correct or incorrect.
  - `score`: An integer representing the score of the answer, ranging from 0 to 100.
## Examples
- **Input Answer**: Quantum physics belongs to the field of physics.
- **Standard Answer**: Quantum physics belongs to the field of physics.
- **Output**:
  ```json
  {"is_correct": true, "reason": "The input answer correctly states that quantum physics belongs to the field of physics.", "score": 100}
  ```
- **Input Answer**: Quantum physics is a study of biology.
- **Standard Answer**: Quantum physics belongs to the field of physics.
- **Output**:
  ```json
  {"is_correct": false, "reason": "The input answer incorrectly states that quantum physics is a study of biology.", "score": 0}
  ```
- **Input Answer**: Quantum physics is the study of microscopic particles.
- **Standard Answer**: Quantum physics belongs to the field of physics.
- **Output**:
  ```json
  {"is_correct": true, "reason": "The input answer roughly describes the subject of quantum physics but does not explicitly state that it belongs to the field of physics.", "score": 80}
  ```
- **Input Answer**: Quantum physics is a part of physics that studies microscopic particles.
- **Standard Answer**: Quantum physics belongs to the field of physics.
- **Output**:
  ```json
  {"is_correct": true, "reason": "The input answer correctly states that quantum physics belongs to the field of physics and adds information about the subject of study.", "score": 90}
